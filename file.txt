The friends and relatives dance in front of the procession. Along with this, firecrackers are also burst, in frequent succession, adding to the festivities and announcing the arrival of the groom.

Sometimes, it is only the close family members, who are welcomed with money, it is also customary to throw money in the air which is collected by the poor people and men playing the band.

The bride is then brought forward, surrounded by her friends and relatives, for exchanging garlands with the groom. After this, the bride and the groom are seated on a raised platform, on throne like chairs.

All the guests then come turn wise to give their good wishes and wedding gifts.

The festivities do not end here they continue for another two to three days. The ‘Bidaai’, entry of the bride into the new family, reception, all are occasions to celebrate. In short, an Indian wedding is a rich bonanza, replete with rituals and ceremonies.

Very recently, I attended the marriage of my cousin. All the members of our family were invited to the wedding. We got new clothes stitched for this occasion. We reached the house of my cousin three days before the actual ceremony. We found a lot of hustle and bustle in the ho9use. A halwai had been engaged to prepare sweets and other eatables. A day before the marriage, a shamiana was put up in the open space before their house. Charis and table sore also arrange in the shamiana for the members of the barat. A speiclaly decorated stage was also made in the shamiana. It was made for the jaimala ceremony of the bride and bridegroom. The entire area was beautifully decorated. Electric lights were also lifted. A welcome gate was put up at the entrance of the shamiana.

The barat came at the appointed time. The bridegroom was riding on a well decorated mare. He was smartly dressed. He had a small boy called ‘Sarbala’ behind him. The members of the marriage party were also well dressed. Some ladies in the barat looked very pretty in their gorgeous sarees. A few youngmen of the barat danced merrily to the tune played by the band. Then the sehra was realized. It gave an impressive account of the kith and kinf of the bridegroom. After that the milni ceremony was gone through then the bride put the jaimala around the neck of the bridegroom. Then the barat was entertained to rich dinner. After a few hours the actual marriage ceremony was performed. The bride and the bridegroom had to go round the holy fire four times. The bride was dressed in a beautiful saree.
